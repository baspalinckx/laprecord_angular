# Lap Record Angular Front-end

To learn more about MEAN stack development all students had to make an Angular front-end with some CRUD based operations implemented. I decided to build a web app for car enthusiast to share their fastest lap times for others to see. 

## I learned

- More about Angular development like routing, dependency injection, string interpolation and much more techniques.
- How to implement a RESTFull API
